                                    Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…? We are not of this race. We are not of this earth. Susan and I are wanderers in the fourth dimension of time and space. My ship…my TARDIS… Mmmmm…. ...history sometimes gives us a terrible shock, and that is because we don't quite fully understand. Why should we? After all, we're too small to realise its final pattern. Therefore don't try and judge it from where you stand. Alright? Of course I'm alright, my child. You know, I am so constantly outwitting the opposition, I tend to forget the delights and satisfaction of the gentle art of fisticuffs.

                                <p>
                                    When I say run, run. ...RUN! I am not a student of human nature. I am a professor of a far wider academy of which human nature is merely a part. Our lives are different from anybody else’s. That’s the exciting thing. Nobody in the universe can do what we’re doing. Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. Butterfingers. I hate computers and refuse to be bullied by them. You've had this place redecorated, haven't you? Hmm, don't like it. There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything we believe in. They must be fought.

                                    Reverse the polarity of… I reversed the polarity of the neutron flow. You know Jo, I sometimes think that military intelligence is a contradiction in terms. Jo, look. That's Skaro. Jo, you’ve got all the time in the world… and all the space. I'm offering them to you. I've reversed the polarity of the Neutron flow, so the TARDIS should be free from the force field now. Death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly. A straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but it is by no means the most interesting.

There's no point being grown-up if you can't be childish sometimes. Would you like a jelly baby? Come on! Are you listening to me? You're a clumsy, ham fisted idiot! You may be a doctor. But I'm the Doctor. The definite article, you might say. You're standing on my scarf. Have a jelly baby. Shut up, K-9! Well, my Doctorate is purely honorary and Harry is only qualified to work on sailors.

                                    For some people, small, beautiful events are what life is all about! There's always something to look at if you open your eyes! Like Alice, I try to believe three impossible things before breakfast. Adric? Dreams are important…never underestimate them. Well, there's a probability of anything. Statistically speaking, if you gave typewriters to a treeful of monkeys, they'd eventually produce the works of William Shakespeare. You may disguise your features but you can never disguise your intent. You know how it is; you put things off for a day and next thing you know, it's a hundred years later.

                                    Change, my dear. And it seems not a moment too soon. Planets come and go. Stars perish. Matter disperses, coalesces, forms into other patterns, other worlds. Nothing can be eternal. It's all right for you, Peri. You've only got one life. You'll age here in the TARDIS and then die. But me, I shall go on regenerating until all my lives are spent. Did I? It must be the carrot juice making me colour blind! You were expecting someone else? A little gratitude wouldn't irretrievably damage my ego. My last incarnation…oh, I was never happy with that one. It had a sort of feckless 'charm' which simply wasn't me.

UNLIMITED RICE PUDDING! Et cetera! Et cetera! Don't worry, Brigadier. People will be shooting at you soon. Every great decision creates ripples. Like a huge boulder dropping in a lake. The ripples merge and rebound off the banks in unforseeable ways. The heavier the decision, the larger the waves, the more uncertain the consequences. You can always judge a man by the quality of his enemies.

                                    Low tech? Grace, this is a type 40 TARDIS, able to take you to any planet in the universe and to any date in that planet's existence. Temporal physics. It was on the planet Skaro that my old enemy the Master was finally put on trial. They say he listened calmly as his list of evil crimes was read... and sentence passed. Then he made his last and I thought somewhat curious request. He demanded that I, the Doctor, a rival Timelord, should take his remains back to our home planet, Gallifrey. I love humans. Always seeing patterns in things that aren't there.

                                    You are the only mystery worth solving. Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted. Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know. No idea. Just do what I do: hold tight and pretend it's a plan. I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name.

                                    Why do you have three mirrors? Why don't you just turn your head? I just have one question… do you know how to fly this thing? Five foot one and crying - you never stood a chance. Mortuaries and larders. Easiest things to break out of. Shut up! Just shut up, shut up, shut up, shuttity up up up! You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. What do you think of the new look? I was hoping for 'minimalism', but I think I came up with 'magician'.
