                Goodbye, Clara. You are the only mystery worth solving. I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard! There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good! Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or, as I’ve always known him, Jeff.

                <p>
                    Oh, for God's sake! Gallfrey stands! A TARDIS is my ship that carries me through Time and Space. T-A-R-D-I-S. It stands for Time And Relative Dimension In Space. My personal plan is that a thing will probably happen quite soon. There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good!

                Exterminate! Delete! Moisturize me! Dovros has no eyes. Evil snow. Missy is the greatest. Morgaine hates Merlin. Nothing in the world can stop me now! Weng-Chiang or Magnus Greel? Daleks! Daleks! Daleks! Beep Beep Beep the Meep. Beep the Meep's weapon of choice was black star radiation
