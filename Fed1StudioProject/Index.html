                    A Little About WHO We Are
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Goodbye, Clara. You are the only mystery worth solving. I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard! There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good! Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or, as I’ve always known him, Jeff.

                <p>
                    Oh, for God's sake! Gallfrey stands! A TARDIS is my ship that carries me through Time and Space. T-A-R-D-I-S. It stands for Time And Relative Dimension In Space. My personal plan is that a thing will probably happen quite soon. There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good! I had to face my fear…that was more important than just going on living…. I don’t like it. Geronimo! There’s always something to look at if you open your eyes! And everybody lives, Rose! Everybody lives! I need more days like this! Go on, ask me anything; I’m on fire! Goodbye, Clara. Alright? Of course I’m alright, my child. You know, I am so constantly outwitting the opposition, I tend to forget the delights and satisfaction of the gentle art of fisticuffs. Well, I’m still not the man I used to be… thank goodness.

                        Exterminate! Delete! Moisturize me! Dovros has no eyes. Evil snow. Missy is the greatest. Morgaine hates Merlin. Nothing in the world can stop me now! Weng-Chiang or Magnus Greel? Daleks! Daleks! Daleks! Beep Beep Beep the Meep. Beep the Meep's weapon of choice was black star radiation. Don't trust the great intelligence. Don't die in your dream. Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there’s a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us. The least important things, sometimes my dear boy, lead to the greatest discoveries. Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame. Whatever the cost. Why can’t you leave me alone?! Allow me to congratulate you, sir. You have the most totally closed mind that I’ve ever encountered. Butterfingers. Allons-y! When I say run, run. …RUN!
